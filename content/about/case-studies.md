## Aleksandar Anđelović: The Letters of Michael Psellos: Networks, Diplomacy, Mobility

This case study investigates the letters of Michael Psellos (1018-1078), one of Byzantium’s most prolific intellectuals, court advisors, and epistolographers. Long dispersed across multiple editions, Psellos’ more than 500 surviving letters have only recently been unified in Stratis Papaioannou’s critical edition, enabling a holistic analysis of the corpus. Approaching the letters as a coherent body allows us to trace the networks, hierarchies, and geographies through which Psellos and his contemporaries navigated mid-eleventh-century Byzantine society. The correspondence reveals Constantinople as the unquestioned center of cultural authority and identity, while the provinces emerge as spaces of economic obligation, bureaucratic friction, and monastic management. At the same time, Psellos invests symbolic and rhetorical significance in classical and scriptural landscapes such as Athens and Jerusalem, positioning them within a hierarchy of cultural memory. His letters thus illuminate both the practical dimensions of imperial governance – property disputes, taxation, judicial appeals – and the cultural codes shared among elite correspondents. By highlighting the interplay of space, mobility, and text, this case study demonstrates how Psellos’ correspondence provides a uniquely rich window onto the social, political, and intellectual dynamics of eleventh-century Byzantium. In doing so, the analysis also speaks directly to current debates on Romanness, practical governance, and the elitist worldview in Byzantium.

## Lewis Read: Armenians between Byzantium and the Seljuq Turks

Historiography in the field of Armenian Studies has typically approached eleventh-century Armenia through two successive paradigms. The period prior to 1045 is generally framed in terms of the gradual and inexorable expansion of the Byzantine Empire, culminating in the annexation of the Armenian Kingdom of Ani and the displacement of its social elite. By contrast, the years following 1045 are largely defined by the destructive incursions of the Seljuk Turks and the ancillary movement of Armenian elites into Cilicia. The historical experiences of political dispossession and displacement sit uneasily within the state-centered methodological conventions that have long shaped Armenian historiography, leaving the period between 1000 and 1095 comparatively underexamined. This case study seeks to address this gap by foregrounding Armenian manuscript colophons as critical sources for the investigation of eleventh-century Armenia. This rich corpus of paratextual material not only offers fresh and diverse perspectives on the socio-cultural, economic, literary, intellectual, and political conditions of the Eastern Mediterranean during this period, but also provides a critical means of interrogating a dominant framework that has approached eleventh-century Armenia primarily from within the interpretive horizons of loss and dislocation established by medieval Armenian historiography.

## Márton Rózsa: Movement and Power in Central Europe

The primary focus of this case study on Central Europe is the problem of how local rulers utilized itinerant individuals for their policies. One can identify specific factors – namely, Christianization, political and administrative development, and conflicts – that prompted people to move. The eleventh century marked a transition period in the spheres of religion and politics. The Christianization of Bohemia started in the ninth century, while the conversion of Poland and Hungary began in the tenth, but the process lasted until the 13th century. Nevertheless, Christianization forged special bonds between Central Europe and the rest of Christendom in the eleventh century, which are of interest to our research on the movement of individuals and the perception of space. Modern historians have already observed numerous movements in medieval Central Europe, yet a thorough analysis within the regional context remains necessary. The case study poses specific questions regarding the political implications of individuals in motion. What was the function of the movements that seemed to be influenced or managed by the central government? Who were the agents of these directed actions? In what ways did the court intervene in movements that were not directly induced by the central government? Who benefited from the rulers’ oversight of these movements? Which factors limited the authority of sovereigns over individuals on the move? These questions establish the groundwork for our investigation of politics in eleventh-century Central Europe through the lens of individuals' spatial movement.


## Katalin Prajda: The *nationes*: Formation of an Identity

This case study aims to contribute to one of the central metanarratives of Italian historiography: the formation of collective identity, particularly in the context of trading nations. It is generally accepted that such forms of identity begin to appear in written sources only after the eleventh century. While certain regions—such as various Tuscan cities and Rome—benefit from relatively rich archives, others, notably Venice, remain significantly lacking both in the quantity and quality of surviving documentation. To address this gap, a semantic analysis has been conducted on 370 notarial acts, both published and unpublished ones, predominantly produced in Venice between 1001 and 1095. Preliminary findings support the prevailing scholarly consensus that territorial affiliation played a limited role in personal identification during this period. Consequently, Venice, as a place of origin and a representation of collective identity, is only rarely associated in these records with individual names. This observation is especially evident in the self-definition and self-identification of notaries within these notarial acts. Conversely, in the identification of third parties by these same notaries, references to place of origin or natio as qualifying attributes do appear, though infrequently.

## Elisabetta Magnanti: Information-Theoretic Metrics for Networks of Historical Writing

This case study examines the cross-Channel transmission of eleven entries from the so-called ‘Annals of Rouen’, tracing their dissemination and reception within Norman and English historiographical traditions between the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Drawing on information-theoretic metrics—a Deviation Rate derived from Shannon entropy and Jensen–Shannon Divergence—it analyses textual relationships across a corpus of Norman sources (including the Annals of Saint-Évroult and the Annals of Jumièges) and Anglo-Latin compilations (the E- and F-texts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Henry of Huntingdon’s Historia Anglorum, and the Waverley Annals). The study demonstrates that entropy-based models can yield quantifiable insights into the dynamics of textual transmission, while also establishing a methodological framework that integrates computational analysis with traditional philological enquiry.

## Lukas Plank & Kevin Stadler: Towards Declarative Linked Data Backends

Linked data and knowledge graph technologies are powerful tools for integrating, connecting, and reasoning over complex information from diverse sources. They excel at revealing relationships between entities, supporting semantic search, and powering AI systems with structured context. However, for non-specialist users, the technical representations of triples, ontologies, and graph structures can be difficult to understand and interact with. The RELEVEN project implements a heavily reified CIDOC-CRM based knowledge graph to represent historical claims with full contextual provenance. Exposing such complex semantic data to consuming applications presents significant technical challenges. This case study addresses these challenges by proposing a model-driven approach for building REST APIs on top of SPARQL endpoints by combining RDFProxy — a Python library for mapping SPARQL query results to Pydantic models — with WissKAS, a command-line tool capable of automatically generating RDFProxy endpoints from a declarative RDF path expression language.

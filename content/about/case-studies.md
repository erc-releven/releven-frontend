This case study investigates the letters of Michael Psellos (1018-1078), one of Byzantium’s most prolific intellectuals, court advisors, and epistolographers. Long dispersed across multiple editions, Psellos’ more than 500 surviving letters have only recently been unified in Stratis Papaioannou’s critical edition, enabling a holistic analysis of the corpus. Approaching the letters as a coherent body allows us to trace the networks, hierarchies, and geographies through which Psellos and his contemporaries navigated mid-eleventh-century Byzantine society. The correspondence reveals Constantinople as the unquestioned center of cultural authority and identity, while the provinces emerge as spaces of economic obligation, bureaucratic friction, and monastic management. At the same time, Psellos invests symbolic and rhetorical significance in classical and scriptural landscapes such as Athens and Jerusalem, positioning them within a hierarchy of cultural memory. His letters thus illuminate both the practical dimensions of imperial governance – property disputes, taxation, judicial appeals – and the cultural codes shared among elite correspondents. By highlighting the interplay of space, mobility, and text, this case study demonstrates how Psellos’ correspondence provides a uniquely rich window onto the social, political, and intellectual dynamics of eleventh-century Byzantium. In doing so, the analysis also speaks directly to current debates on Romanness, practical governance, and the elitist worldview in Byzantium.

Historiography in the field of Armenian Studies has typically approached eleventh-century Armenia through two successive paradigms. The period prior to 1045 is generally framed in terms of the gradual and inexorable expansion of the Byzantine Empire, culminating in the annexation of the Armenian Kingdom of Ani and the displacement of its social elite. By contrast, the years following 1045 are largely defined by the destructive incursions of the Seljuk Turks and the ancillary movement of Armenian elites into Cilicia. The historical experiences of political dispossession and displacement sit uneasily within the state-centered methodological conventions that have long shaped Armenian historiography, leaving the period between 1000 and 1095 comparatively underexamined. This case study seeks to address this gap by foregrounding Armenian manuscript colophons as critical sources for the investigation of eleventh-century Armenia. This rich corpus of paratextual material not only offers fresh and diverse perspectives on the socio-cultural, economic, literary, intellectual, and political conditions of the Eastern Mediterranean during this period, but also provides a critical means of interrogating a dominant framework that has approached eleventh-century Armenia primarily from within the interpretive horizons of loss and dislocation established by medieval Armenian historiography.

This case study aims to contribute to one of the central metanarratives of Italian historiography: the formation of collective identity, particularly in the context of trading nations. It is generally accepted that such forms of identity begin to appear in written sources only after the eleventh century. While certain regions—such as various Tuscan cities and Rome—benefit from relatively rich archives, others, notably Venice, remain significantly lacking both in the quantity and quality of surviving documentation. To address this gap, a semantic analysis has been conducted on 370 notarial acts, both published and unpublished ones, predominantly produced in Venice between 1001 and 1095. Preliminary findings support the prevailing scholarly consensus that territorial affiliation played a limited role in personal identification during this period. Consequently, Venice, as a place of origin and a representation of collective identity, is only rarely associated in these records with individual names. This observation is especially evident in the self-definition and self-identification of notaries within these notarial acts. Conversely, in the identification of third parties by these same notaries, references to place of origin or natio as qualifying attributes do appear, though infrequently.

This case study examines the cross-Channel transmission of eleven entries from the so-called ‘Annals of Rouen’, tracing their dissemination and reception within Norman and English historiographical traditions between the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Drawing on information-theoretic metrics—a Deviation Rate derived from Shannon entropy and Jensen–Shannon Divergence—it analyses textual relationships across a corpus of Norman sources (including the Annals of Saint-Évroult and the Annals of Jumièges) and Anglo-Latin compilations (the E- and F-texts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Henry of Huntingdon’s Historia Anglorum, and the Waverley Annals). The study demonstrates that entropy-based models can yield quantifiable insights into the dynamics of textual transmission, while also establishing a methodological framework that integrates computational analysis with traditional philological enquiry.

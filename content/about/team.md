## Tara Andrews

Tara Andrews is the principal investigator of RELEVEN. She became University Professor of Digital Humanities at the Institute for History in 2016. She has also served as a Scientific Director of the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH) at the ÖAW since 2018. With a Bachelor of Science in Humanities and Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1999), and the degrees of Master (2005) and Doctor (2009) of Philosophy in Byzantine and Armenian studies from the University of Oxford, her dual scientific training as well as her professional experience in the software industry has provided valuable and rare perspectives on the use of digital and computational methods in humanities domains. Andrews’ fields of expertise include the history and historiography of the Christian Near East in the tenth to twelfth centuries, the application of computational and statistical methods for reconstruction of the copying history of ancient and medieval manuscripts (stemmatology), and reflection on the implications of employing digital media and computational methods in humanities contexts. She has been invited to give keynote presentations at both academic and industry conferences, has contributed to both the Armenian-source content and the technical maintenance of the online “Prosopography of the Byzantine World”, has edited or co-edited two collections of papers on the subject of software and computational analysis in textual studies, and has published several journal articles as well as a monograph on topics that cover both medieval Armenian history and digital scholarly practice. Her scientific output also extends to research software, most notably the ‘Stemmaweb’ suite of online tools for analysis of text variants and their associated stemma hypotheses, but also including a range of smaller tools whose source code has been released to the public on Github. From 2021–2026 she will be PI of the ERC project RELEVEN, aiming to bring a new perspective to the history of the eleventh century in the Christian world by digitally re-modeling the data we have.

## Katalin Prajda

Katalin Prajda is a historian of medieval and early Renaissance Italy, who has held a number of postdoctoral fellowships, among others at the University of Chicago, the Villa I Tatti - The Harvard Center for Renaissance Studies, Central European University and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Her studies concern the coevolution of trade, political, kinship, and artistic networks, with a focus on migration and cultural exchanges. In the framework of the project, she is working on the re-evaluation of the history of Trieste and Istria as borderlands.

## Márton Rózsa
Martón Rózsa is a historian with a special interest in the social history of Byzantium in the eleventh and twelfth century. He completed his doctoral studies at Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, in 2019 and wrote his dissertation about the Byzantine second-tier elite in the "long" twelfth century (1081-1204). He held a number of predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships at Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, and the University of Vienna. He also attended the Numismatics and Sigillography Summer Program at Dumbarton Oaks in 2015. In the framework of RELEVEN he focuses on the changes of the Byzantine elite and the correlations between politics and the mobility of people in Central Europe.

## Lewis Read

Lewis Read is a trained Armenologist who holds an MA in Medieval History (2019) and MLitt in Middle Eastern History and Arabic (2020) from the University of St Andrews, with further training in natural language processing, computational linguistics, and automated semantic analysis through machine learning from the University of Oxford and the University of Vienna. Lewis’ research specialises in medieval Armenia from the fifth to eleventh century – with a focus on historical, palaeographical and philological analysis of medieval Armenian source material – and explores the application of digital tools for the study of Armenian manuscripts.

His doctoral thesis focuses on Chalcedonian Armenian translation activity in the tenth and eleventh century and the role of Graeco-Armenian translations in conditioning Armeno-Byzantine relations during the expansion of the Byzantine Empire into Anatolia, the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Northern Syria.

## Aleksandar Anđelović

Aleksandar Anđelović is a classical philologist and medievalist with a broad interest in education, religion, reception of paideia and of the Bible in the late antique and Byzantine eastern Mediterranean. He received his BA and first MA degree in Classics from the University of Belgrade in 2016 and 2018 respectively. In 2021 he graduated from the Department of Medieval Studies at the Central European University in Budapest and Vienna, with a MA thesis investigating the two late antique Latin translations of the Greek Life of Antony. At CEU he also received an Advanced Certificate from the Center of Religious Studies. He studied Modern Greek in Athens and Thessaloniki, and has actively participated in conferences in Croatia, North Macedonia, and Slovenia.

Aleksandar is one of our two prae doc researchers on RELEVEN. His PhD thesis will aim to offer a thorough investigation of the role of learning and education, both secular and religious, as perceived by prominent Christian intellectuals and ecclesiastical leaders in eleventh-century Byzantium.

## Elisabetta Magnanti

Dr. Elisabetta Magnanti is a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of History at the University of Vienna. With a background in computer science and philology, her research focuses on the application of computational methods to the palaeographical and philological analysis of Old English and Anglo-Latin source material.
